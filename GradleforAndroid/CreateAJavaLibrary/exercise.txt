Time for you to modularize your joke telling app. You'll create a joke telling
app, and not one, but two Java libraries!

1. Create a new project in Android Studio, using all the defaults.

2. Manually add a Java module with a class called JokeSmith with a getJoke()
method. Feel free to supply a funny joke, or just a debug method, if
you're no fun. Remember to set sourceCompatibility = 1.7, so your library is
usable on Android. This line should be added to the build.gradle file of the
module.

3. Add your new module to your settings.gradle file

4. Declare a project dependency between your app and JokeSmith

5. Add a text view to MainActivityFragment and populate it with a joke from
JokeSmith.

6. Use the Android Studio wizard to add a second Java library called
JokeWizard. To access the wizard, navigate to:

    File > New > New Module > Java Library

Note that the wizard adds JokeWizard to your settings.gradle

7. Declare a project dependency between JokeWizard and JokeSmith

8. Implement a getJoke() method on JokeWizard that uses the getJoke() method
on JokeSmith.

9. Add a project dependence between your app and JokeWizard

10. Add another text view to MainActivityFragment and populate it with a joke
from JokeWizard.

11.Use the Android Studio wizard to add an Android Library project:

    File > New > New Module... > Android Library

12. Add a new activity to the library

13. Add a button to the main activity that retrieves a joke from the Java
library, packages the joke as an intent extra, and launches the activity from
the Android library.

14. Have the activity in the Android Library retrieve and display the joke.
